										<h2>Unit 1 – Information Security Management</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>The CIA triad defines the principles or goals of cybersecurity and I believe
									it does a decent job to define security goals at a high level where details can 
									be added as technologies and motives of bad actors evolve.
									</p>
									
									<p>Having said that I believe a framework needs to be more complete. Let’s take an example
									of network OSI layers, each layer is built on previous layer, i.e. each layers builds the
									foundation for the layer above, physical layer builds foundation for data link layer and so on. The relationships and dependencies are missing in the CIA triad, it simply describes the high-level objectives. Let’s take an example of ransomware attack, at the stage of attacker asking for ransom and threatening to release data etc. at that point in time has the confidentiality been already breached and if it is considered to have breached than what further value can be added by accepting the attackers demands?. What are the characteristics or conditions that must be met for confidentiality to be breached? This was just a single example, but I think a more complete framework for security goals must be created.
									</p>
									<p>
										I will be keeping an eye for this type of information i.e. relationships and dependencies between security goals and principles. The material around risk management might be able to address these concerns.
									</p>
									<p>
									I believe information risk management is an interesting area, the skills and knowledge needed to be successful spans both the specific business of an organization as well as understanding the technology. Quantifying risk to business using technology metrics is marrying two very diverse fields I will be looking to address this gap by taking business related courses in the future.

										<h2>Unit 2 - Real World Issues and Implications of Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I struggled to put the mannequin case study in an appropriate context. Was the case study about medical system security threat modeling or was it for a generic Wi-Fi based wireless system security. The case study showed how WEP wireless security can be compromised using brute force attack and how medical mannequin system was using non encrypted HTTP connections rather than HTTPS.
									</p>
									<p>
									The concern I had was around responsibility boundaries, is the medical mannequin system considered a fully contained system with its own internal communication channels (Wi-Fi) or is it a sum of its components (server, software, hardware, and communication equipment). This question has implications in real life, who is responsible for the security, is it the system manufacturer who will design and implement the appropriate security or will it be the teaching institution IT department providing connectivity (Wi-Fi) services to the medial mannequin.	
									</p>	
									
									<p>
									Our Group 1 had meetings to prepare for the seminar 1. We spent considerable time discussing whether the case study represents a medical industry security threat modeling exercise or a generic Wi-Fi security. I raised my point around system security vs component security and whether the manufacturers of mannequin system should be responsible for the system security or the Wi-Fi service providers.
