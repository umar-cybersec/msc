										<h2>Unit 1 – Information Security Management</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>The CIA triad defines the principles or goals of cybersecurity and I believe
									it does a decent job to define security goals at a high level where details can 
									be added as technologies and motives of bad actors evolve.
									</p>
									
									<p>Having said that I believe a framework needs to be more complete. Let’s take an example
									of network OSI layers, each layer is built on previous layer, i.e. each layers builds the
									foundation for the layer above, physical layer builds foundation for data link layer and so on. The relationships and dependencies are missing in the CIA triad, it simply describes the high-level objectives. Let’s take an example of ransomware attack, at the stage of attacker asking for ransom and threatening to release data etc. at that point in time has the confidentiality been already breached and if it is considered to have breached than what further value can be added by accepting the attackers demands?. What are the characteristics or conditions that must be met for confidentiality to be breached? This was just a single example, but I think a more complete framework for security goals must be created.
									</p>
									<p>
										I will be keeping an eye for this type of information i.e. relationships and dependencies between security goals and principles. The material around risk management might be able to address these concerns.
									</p>
									<p>
									I believe information risk management is an interesting area, the skills and knowledge needed to be successful spans both the specific business of an organization as well as understanding the technology. Quantifying risk to business using technology metrics is marrying two very diverse fields I will be looking to address this gap by taking business related courses in the future.

										<h2>Unit 2 - Real World Issues and Implications of Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I struggled to put the mannequin case study in an appropriate context. Was the case study about medical system security threat modeling or was it for a generic Wi-Fi based wireless system security. The case study showed how WEP wireless security can be compromised using brute force attack and how medical mannequin system was using non encrypted HTTP connections rather than HTTPS.
									</p>
									<p>
									The concern I had was around responsibility boundaries, is the medical mannequin system considered a fully contained system with its own internal communication channels (Wi-Fi) or is it a sum of its components (server, software, hardware, and communication equipment). This question has implications in real life, who is responsible for the security, is it the system manufacturer who will design and implement the appropriate security or will it be the teaching institution IT department providing connectivity (Wi-Fi) services to the medial mannequin.	
									</p>	
									
									<p>
									Our Group 1 had meetings to prepare for the seminar 1. We spent considerable time discussing whether the case study represents a medical industry security threat modeling exercise or a generic Wi-Fi security. I raised my point around system security vs component security and whether the manufacturers of mannequin system should be responsible for the system security or the Wi-Fi service providers.

										<h2>Unit 3: Network Fundamentals</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a networking professional with considerable experience, my first inclination was that might not gain much new knowledge, however that wasn’t the case. The experience of installing Kali linux and exploring various tools such as nmap etc. were invaluable. I was impressed by the tools provided in kali linux as well the offensive security certification of OSCP. I believe ethical hacking and penetration testing skills are essential for any cybersecurity professional. The techniques used by ethical hackers provide a baseline knowledge and framework to start thinking like a hacker. 
									</p>
									<p>
									Difference between a vulnerability and exploit was something that always remained in my mind, this idea was further explored in this module. Kali Linux Metasploit tool provides a mechanism to develop your own custom exploits and the ability to use the exploit against a target system. 
									</p>
									<p>
									I also wondered the value of learning python programming language in the context of cybersecurity and penetration testing, exploring kali Linux showed me how something like ping sweeps with varying types of payloads can be automated using python.

										<h2>Unit 4: Basic Network Investigation Using Standard Tools</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The vulnerability assessment process and the importance of network reconnaissance was an important learning outcome, especially the concepts of foot printing (determining what and where the assets are) and fingerprinting (characteristics of assets in terms of OS versions, types etc.)
									</p>
									<p>
									The discussion around comparison of TCP/IP and OSI was personally very satisfying for myself. The fact that TCP/IP has survived as a protocol stack while OSI has survived as a framework was acknowledged by our course tutor as well.

										<h2>Unit 5: Network Tools and Components</h2>

									<p>In one of the peer replies I pointed out the usage of whois and the fact that whois can be performed on both IP and domain name, both providing unique results. However, dns lookup is always performed to map names to IP addresses, for example performing a ping on domain name does not mean that name to IP resolution has not taken place.

										<h2>Unit 7: Risks and Standards</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									The paper “A Comparison Study of Open-Source Penetration Testing Tools” compares following tools
									Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Aircrack, John the Ripper and Sqlmap.</p>
									<p>
									I disagree with the fundamental approach of comparing disparate tools which are designed to solve different problems. Nmap is a network mapping reconnaissance tool while wireshark captures the data traffic which can be analyze, similarly Metasploit is an exploit usage and development tool and john the Ripper is a brute force password cracker while sqlmap is sql vulnerability/weakness tool.</p>
									<p>The comparison should have been done based on the efficacy of each tool using a normalized scale of 1-10.</p>

										<h2>Unit 8: How to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards</h2>
										<h2>Unit 9: System Logging and Forensics</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									In my summary post I reiterated the idea of using law enforcement evidence handling techniques as a basis to form digital data handling processes. Our course tutor chimed in with the idea of physical security controls as well, however I would also raise a concern that security is a continuous process and no matter how much due diligence is put in place certain aspects will always escape. I provided an example of using a mobile phone recording device to capture the CCTV footage, to prevent this scenario untrusted persons might be disallowed to be in the vicinity of video playback even if they possess prior security clearance for example cleaning staff etc. 
									</p>
									<p>
									On the same theme let’s consider nuclear reactor site which is secured by physical controls as well as network air gap between the facilities and the outside world, even in this case there are instances of using a physical USB stick to penetrate and drop malware in the system (Iranian nuclear reactor breach).	
									</p>
									<p>
									As a summary note I would argue that security controls no matter how robust cannot achieve 100% security, breach handling, forensics and continuous audits and validations are important even if they are only helping to add little value (laws of diminishing returns). This is an interesting philosophical point, and I will continue to look explore these ideas further.	
									</p>
									<p>
									In a group meeting I discussed a personal anecdote regarding use of system logging and forensics. Security team at a large financial institution is trying to make sure no unauthorized network/system access ever takes and in case of breach it is recorded and actioned upon. External vendors/contractors are further outsourcing technology related tasks to 3rd parties without prior consent of the financial institution thus causing unauthorized access of system and data. If the 3rd parties are using the same webex/screen sharing software and authentication as the legitimate contractors/vendors, then it becomes extremely difficult to determine the breach. 
									I think this is one area where AI/ML can be used so an established pattern of legitimate use is established and any deviation from that behavior is flagged.
